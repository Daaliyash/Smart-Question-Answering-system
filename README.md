# Smart-Improvised-Question-Answering-system
Every large organization has a massive collection of documents that it can use to build a Question Answering systems to serve and solve the queries of stakeholders in that institute. Hence we propose a Question Answering System based on official documents available in a university. Although multiple solutions have existed for Question Answering systems. We are proposing the use of stacked layer of LSTMs (Long short term memory) to get the corresponding answer for the particular question where the words (tokens) are fed as input to the neural networks. We are using the BERT model for keywords extraction and feeding it to the LSTM neural net. This solutions is being built especially useful for Universities that have very large number of Normative and Directive documents. This solution can be used to quickly provide response to studentsâ€™ queries whenever they visit the site without requiring them to visit individual sub components of the site. It makes the use of existing dataset in the organization while saving a lot of time for the students and staffs.
